**Experience.** I am a self taught artist, working on paintings with acrylic and oil since 2019.
Won best in category for painting at University of Michigan and was listed on the university magazine.

**Interests.** My major focus is on nature and land scaling paintings. 
Besides this, I also encorporate wild animals, birds, abstract objects, still life and portraits of animals and humans. Over time I have developed interest in wall murals and pottery too.
